# Data Modeling Using Erwin Software
This was a project for a database design and development class. <br>
Screenshots of my work are provided according to the requirements. <br> 
(_As I am using the academic edition of Erwin, it does not allow for direct source file connection to Github._) <br><br>
**Project Instructions:** [View Here](/CIS3050-Project1_Fall_2023.pdf) <br>
**Project Reflection and Explanation of Functional Dependencies:** [View Here](https://github.com/sebastian-huynh/erwin-data-models/blob/9fb5132bcc191d736eebcc0142521b0424a3f917/EERD%20Functional%20Dependency%20Report.pdf) <br><br>

**Conceptual level** of the entity relationship diagram displays the four independent, strong entities (_Department, Supervisor, Employee, and Project_). It also displays the bridging, associative entities between them (_Department_Employee, Supervisor_Employee, and Project_Assignment_) that are required to facilitate the many-to-many cardinalities. There is also the parent-child entity relationship seen between "Project" and "Task". <br><br>
